### A sleek and modern project that encourages and allows individuals to find charities and donate to good causes

Phaze is a web-based application that allows users to effortlessly find charities to donate to! This project contains HTML, CSS, and Flask files, along with a 'static' folder that holds various images and code. In this README, we will guide both newcomers and experienced developers through the key aspects of this project.

This project is made for RocketHacks 2024 by **Dhruv Rakhade, Alex Sheng, and Tharun Naguleswaran**.

## Introduction

Phaze is a simple yet powerful tool that enables users with good intentions to find foundations rooted in giving back to the less fortunate. Whether you are interested in helping the community, a student, or a developer looking to learn and experiment with Flask, this project offers something for everyone.

## Our Purpose

Phaze is designed to help not just those in need, but to also educate everyone on where charitable causes can be found. Users can see existing charities and movements on Phaze, which allows for charity organizers to receive a massive boost from Phaze.

*Disclaimer: User-uploaded charities may not always be legitimate. Users should use their own judgement.*

### Key Features

- Adding charities that will show up on our Google Map
- A user-friendly web interface
- Real-time map updates
- A modern and sleek signup and login page
- Beautifully curated user interface

## Getting Started

To start using Phaze, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/phaze.git

2. Open the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd phaze

3. Run the command

  ```bash
  flask --app app run
  ```

4. Open the URL given by Flask to access the website

5. Follow the instructions on the website.

*You may need to set up a Virtual Environment in Python, or 'venv'*

## Usage

If you're new to web development or just want to use the application, here's a simple guide:

Open the charity finder by following the "Getting Started" steps.

1. You'll see an page labeled "Add a Charity". You can add a pre-existing charity and promote it on the internet now!
2. Press the "Upload Charity" button, and the charity will appear on the directory and on the map.

## Simplicity

Phaze focuses on a simplistic web design, for maximum user experience, and modern, sleek user interface. With reduced distractions, this carries the purpose, motivation, and essence of Phaze. According to websitemagazine.com, "Simple design makes it easy to draw the viewer's eye to the most important area of the page - and, if you're looking for conversions, that's your call to action. Navigating a cluttered interface is no fun. It can be confusing, overwhelming and frustrating" (Lundin).

## Extensibility

We plan to further expand the website's capabilities and functions. Additionally, we also would like to enhance 'Phaze', and make it more world-renowned through heavy improvements so that communities spread nations apart can come together for the same benevolent causes. Phaze, despite already being capable of a large amount, has immense improvement potential, having the opportunity to be recognized on an international scale, for advocating for a more well-off world. Improvements that could be made in the future are open respectful discussion forums and threads about various charities, open tags to sort categories to help people find what they're looking for, and automate functional and efficient moderation of charity making, only to name a few. We would like to one day develop Phaze to a more extensive, refurbished point, and raise awareness to give back to our communities in need. The potential is vast, and the uses for Phaze are limitless, with our aspirations to create a healthy community growing in the future.


## Customization

Experienced developers may want to customize the project further. You can modify the code to change the appearance of the homepage, add additional features, or integrate it into other web applications.

- The Flask code for this project can be found in the app.py file. We also use jQuery for sleek JavaScript operations in our HTML files.

- The code listens for form submissions using Flask. When the form is submitted, it retrieves the file from the user's computer, and uploads it into our safe and secure database.

Happy Phazing! üíªüó∫Ô∏è
